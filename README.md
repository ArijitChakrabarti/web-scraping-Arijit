# WEB SCRAPING

As the name suggests - Web Scraping is the process of collecting structured data present on the web in an automated fashion. I developed the code to use as part of my first EDA project - where the data present on the website, in this case www.countrycodes.org - was needed.  These few lines of code has helped me immensely wherever there is lots of online data structured in the form of a table.  As long as one can identify the start point of the table by inspecting the html code - the rest is as easy as apple pie.
